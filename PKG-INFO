        # Installation on your local computer
        
        # ClointFusion is now supported in Windows / Ubuntu / macOS !
        
        1. Please install Python 3.8.5 with 64 bit: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads" target="_blank"> Python 3.8.5 64 Bit</a>
        
        2. It is recommended to run ClointFusion in a Virtual Environment.
        Please refer these steps to create one, as per your OS: <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment" target="_blank">Creating a virtual environment in Windows / Mac / Ubuntu</a>
        
        3. Install ClointFusion by executing this package in command promt (with Admin rights): 
        
            ## pip install --upgrade ClointFusion
        4. Open a new file in your favorite Python IDE and type: 
        
            ## import ClointFusion as cf
        
        ---
        # ClointFusion Self Test: 
        Check whether all functions of ClointFusion are compatible with your computer settings & configurations:
        
        ## cf.clointfusion_self_test()
        ---
        
        ## Now access all 120 functions (hit ctrl+space in your IDE)
        
        * 9 functions on Mouse operations. Type cf.mouse 
        
        * 5 functions on Window operations (works only in Windows OS). Type cf.window 
        
        * 7 functions on Folder operations. Type cf.folder 
        
        * 28 functions on Excel operations. Type cf.excel 
        
        * 4 functions on Keyboard operations. Type cf.key
        
        * 2 functions on Screenscraping operations. Type cf.scrape
        
        * 21 functions on Browser operations. Type cf.browser
        
        * Loads of miscellaneous functions related to OCR, Send WhatsApp Message, Send Email using Outlook Desktop app (works only in Windows OS), emoji, capture photo, flash (pop-up) messages etc.
        
        # ClointFusion's function works in different modes:
        1) If you pass all the required parameters, function works silently. So, this is Non-GUI mode.
        
        2) If you do not pass any parameter, GUI would pop-up asking you the required parameters. Next time, when you run the BOT, based upon your configuration, which you get to choose at the beginning of BOT run:
        
                A) If Semi-Automatic mode is OFF, GUI would pop-up again, showing you the previous entries, allowing you to modify the parameters.
        
                B) If Semi-Automatic mode in ON, BOT works silently taking your previous GUI entries.
        
            Non-GUI mode gives you more control over the function's parameters.
         
            GUI Mode is for beginners. Anytime, if you are not getting how to use the function, just call an empty function (without parameters) and GUI would pop-up asking you for required parameters.
