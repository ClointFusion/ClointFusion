# ClointFusion First Run Setup: 
First time, when you import ClointFusion, you would be prompted to run ClointFusions's Automated Selftest, to check whether all functions of ClointFusion are compatible with your computer settings & configurations. We highly recommend you to share this anonymous report with us, for improving ClointFusion.

* 9 functions on Mouse operations. Type cf.mouse 

* 5 functions on Window operations (works only in Windows OS). Type cf.window

# ClointFusion's function works in different modes:
1) If you pass all the required parameters, function works silently. So, this is Non-GUI mode.

2) If you do not pass any parameter, GUI would pop-up asking you the required parameters. Next time, when you run the BOT, based upon your configuration, which you get to choose at the beginning of BOT run:

        A) If Semi-Automatic mode is OFF, GUI would pop-up again, showing you the previous entries, allowing you to modify the parameters.

        B) If Semi-Automatic mode in ON, BOT works silently taking your previous GUI entries.

    Non-GUI mode gives you more control over the function's parameters.
 
    GUI Mode is for beginners. Anytime, if you are not getting how to use the function, just call an empty function (without parameters) and GUI would pop-up asking you for required parameters.
